## 💡 Philosophy: Beneficial Friction

**TAD is not about making AI do more. It's about making human involvement more valuable.**

Many AI coding tools promise: "Give AI a goal, it handles everything." This sounds appealing, but in practice leads to:
- **Requirement drift**: AI's understanding diverges from what you actually need
- **False quality**: AI says "all tests pass" — but it wrote those tests itself
- **Priority confusion**: AI spends 80% of time on 20% of value

TAD takes a different approach: **AI can do a lot, but must stop at three critical points for human confirmation.**

### The Three Friction Points

| Point | Why Human is Essential | Without Human |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Requirement Clarification** | Only humans know the real problem to solve | AI builds "technically correct but directionally wrong" things |
| **Priority Decision** | Involves resources, time, business judgment | AI sorts by "technical complexity" instead of value |
| **End-to-End Acceptance** | Only humans can judge "does this actually work" | AI passes all unit tests but UX is broken |

These three points correspond to the **Value Guardian** role in the Triangle Model — not participating in every step, but gatekeeping at critical nodes.

### Beneficial vs. Wasteful Friction

| Wasteful Friction | Beneficial Friction |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Copy-pasting code manually | Requirement clarification dialogue |
| Formatting adjustments | Priority decisions |
| Environment setup | End-to-end acceptance testing |
| Waiting for builds | Feedback when acceptance fails |

Wasteful friction should be automated. Beneficial friction should be **preserved and strengthened** — it's where value is created.

### A Deeper Insight

**The stronger AI becomes, the more critical human checkpoints are.**

When AI is weak, humans must participate in every step. When AI is strong, humans can step back to higher levels — but those few critical points become even more important, because once AI deviates there, it races toward the wrong direction faster.

This is why "fully autonomous AI development" is a false premise — **not because AI can't do it, but because AI without human gatekeeping produces unreliable results.**

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install TAD
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sheldon-92/TAD/main/tad.sh | bash
```

### 2. Open Two Terminals

| Terminal 1 | Terminal 2 |
|------------|------------|
| `/alex` | `/blake` |
| Design & Planning | Implementation |

### 3. Start Collaboration

**Terminal 1 (Alex):**
```
You: I want to add user authentication
Alex: [Uses AskUserQuestion to clarify requirements]
Alex: [Creates handoff after Socratic inquiry]
Alex: "Handoff ready. Please tell Blake to execute it in Terminal 2."
```

**Terminal 2 (Blake):**
```
You: Execute the auth handoff
Blake: [Reads handoff, implements, runs Gate 3/4]
Blake: [Creates completion report]
```

**Terminal 1 (Alex):**
```
You: Blake finished, here's the completion report
Alex: [Reviews with subagents, accepts or requests changes]
```

## 🔺 The Triangle Model

```
           Human
       (Value Guardian)
            /\
           /  \
          /    \
         /      \
   Agent A ──── Agent B
  (Solution)  (Execution)
   Terminal 1  Terminal 2
```

### Human - The Value Guardian
- **Defines** what is valuable for users
- **Bridges** information between Alex and Blake
- **Decides** when conflicts arise
- **Verifies** final delivery meets expectations

### Agent A (Alex) - Solution Lead
- **Elicits** requirements through Socratic inquiry
- **Designs** solutions with expert review
- **Creates** handoffs for Blake
- **Owns** Gate 1 (Requirements) & Gate 2 (Design)

### Agent B (Blake) - Execution Master
- **Implements** based on handoff only
- **Tests** with mandatory subagent calls
- **Owns** Gate 3 (Implementation) & Gate 4 (Integration)
- **Reports** completion for Alex review

## 📚 Project Knowledge System

TAD captures project-specific learnings in `.tad/project-knowledge/`:

```
.tad/project-knowledge/
├── README.md           # How to use knowledge system
├── ux.md               # UX patterns and decisions
├── code-quality.md     # Code standards learned
├── security.md         # Security considerations
├── architecture.md     # Architectural decisions
└── [custom].md         # Create new categories as needed
```

### Knowledge Capture Flow
1. Gate 3/4 passes
2. Agent assesses: "Did I learn something project-specific?"
3. If yes → Record in appropriate category
4. If no → Skip (don't record obvious/generic knowledge)

### `/knowledge-audit` Command
Run periodically to check knowledge health:
- Files with content vs empty
- Missing foundational sections
- Categories needing attention

## 💡 Key Principles

These principles are the practical implementation of [Beneficial Friction](#-philosophy-beneficial-friction) — each one preserves a human checkpoint where it matters most, while automating everything else.

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop (Beneficial Friction)
Human is not just a requester but the Value Guardian at three critical friction points: requirement clarification, priority decisions, and end-to-end acceptance. Information flows through the human.

### 2. Design Before Code
Alex designs completely before Blake implements. No implementation without handoff. This ensures requirements are clarified (friction point #1) before any code is written.

### 3. Evidence-Based Quality
Every gate requires evidence. Subagent reviews are mandatory, not optional. Automated checks eliminate wasteful friction; human review at gates preserves beneficial friction.

### 4. Knowledge Accumulation
Project learns from every feature. Patterns captured prevent repeated mistakes.

### 5. Adaptive Complexity
Scale process to task size. Small task = light process. Large task = full TAD. Match the amount of beneficial friction to the risk level.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### "Alex called /blake in same terminal"
This is a VIOLATION. Alex must stop and instruct human to switch to Terminal 2.

### "Gate failed - no evidence file"
Ensure subagents were called and wrote to `.tad/evidence/reviews/`.

### "Handoff created without Socratic inquiry"
Alex must use AskUserQuestion before writing handoff. Re-run with proper flow.

### "Knowledge files empty"
Run `/knowledge-audit --fix` or manually bootstrap with templates.
