# TAD Quality Gates - Manual Verification Checklists

## 🎯 Purpose
These manual checklists provide quality control when automated testing isn't available. Each gate requires explicit verification before proceeding to the next phase.

---

## 🚪 Gate 1: Requirements Clarity Gate

**Trigger:** After human provides requirements, before Agent A starts design

### ✅ Requirements Verification Checklist
**Agent A must verify:**
- [ ] **Business Value Clear**: Can explain WHY this is needed in one sentence
- [ ] **Success Criteria Defined**: Know exactly what "done" looks like
- [ ] **User Story Complete**: Has Who/What/Why structure
- [ ] **Scope Boundaries**: Clear about what's IN and what's OUT
- [ ] **Historical Code Searched**: Checked for existing similar implementations
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable and measurable criteria defined

### ⚠️ Gate Failure Conditions
- Business value unclear → Ask human for clarification
- Success criteria vague → Request specific metrics
- Missing user context → Gather user persona information
- No historical code search → Search before designing

## 🎛️ Gate Management Guidelines

### Manual Gate Execution
1. **Copy checklist** for each gate execution
2. **Fill out each checkbox** explicitly
3. **Document evidence** for each verification
4. **Get explicit approval** before proceeding
5. **Archive completed checklists** in `.tad/working/gates/`

### Emergency Gate Override
If critical business need requires bypassing a gate:
1. **Document the business reason** for override
2. **List the risks** being accepted
3. **Create follow-up tasks** to address skipped checks
4. **Get explicit human approval** for override

### Gate Quality Metrics
Track gate effectiveness:
- **Gate pass rate**: % of first-time gate passes
- **Issue prevention**: Bugs caught at gates vs. in production
- **Cycle time**: Time between gates
- **Rework frequency**: How often gates fail

### Continuous Improvement
After each project:
- **Review gate effectiveness**: Which gates caught real issues?
- **Identify missed issues**: What got through that shouldn't have?
- **Update checklists**: Add new verification points
- **Train agents**: Share learnings from gate experiences
