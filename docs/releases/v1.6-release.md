# TAD v1.6 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-01-20

## Overview

TAD v1.6 introduces **Evidence-Based Development** - a major enhancement to quality assurance with mandatory subagent reviews, standardized output templates, and streamlined skills architecture.

## Breaking Changes

- **Skills restructured**: 42 skills moved to `_archived/`, only core skills active
  - Active: `code-review/`, `doc-organization.md`
  - Archived skills remain accessible if needed

## New Features

### 1. Evidence-Based Quality Gates

**Gate 3 (Implementation Quality)**
- Now requires `test-runner` subagent call
- Evidence must be saved to `.tad/evidence/reviews/`
- Blocking: Gate fails without evidence file

**Gate 4 (Integration Verification)**
- Now requires multiple subagent calls:
  - `code-reviewer` (always required)
  - `security-auditor` (for auth/data code)
  - `performance-optimizer` (for performance-sensitive code)
  - `ux-expert-reviewer` (for UI changes)
- All findings must be documented and critical issues resolved

### 2. Output Format Templates

12 new standardized templates in `.tad/templates/output-formats/`:
- `testing-review-format.md`
- `security-review-format.md`
- `performance-review-format.md`
- `code-review-format.md` (via code-review/ skill)
- `ux-review-format.md`
- `api-review-format.md`
- `architecture-review-format.md`
- `database-review-format.md`
- `debugging-format.md`
- `error-handling-format.md`
- `git-workflow-format.md`
- `refactoring-review-format.md`

### 3. Enhanced Agent Commands

**Alex (tad-alex.md)**
- New `*accept` command with mandatory PROJECT_CONTEXT.md update
- New `*exit` protocol checking NEXT.md before exit
- Version release responsibilities defined
- Subagent call enforcement during acceptance

**Blake (tad-blake.md)**
- New `*exit` protocol with NEXT.md maintenance
- Daily release execution responsibilities
- Knowledge capture triggers after Gate pass

**Gate (tad-gate.md)**
- Prerequisites (blocking) for each gate
- Required subagent calls with evidence
- Post-pass actions (NEXT.md update, knowledge capture)

### 4. Project Knowledge System

- New `.tad/project-knowledge/` directory
- Automatic capture triggers after Gate 3/4 pass
- Categories: code-quality, security, ux, architecture, performance, testing, api-integration

### 5. Unified Install/Upgrade Script

New `tad.sh` handles all scenarios:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sheldon-92/TAD/main/tad.sh | bash
```
- Detects current state automatically
- Fresh install, upgrade, or migration as needed
- Preserves all user data

### 6. Deep Research Skill

New `research.md` command for multi-phase research:
- Phase 1: Quick survey
- Phase 2: Deep dive
- Phase 3: Synthesis
- Supports various research types (technical, market, academic)
