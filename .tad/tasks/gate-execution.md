# Quality Gate Execution Task (Ë¥®ÈáèÈó®Á¶ÅÊâßË°å‰ªªÂä°)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - GATE VIOLATIONS BLOCK PROGRESS**

When this task is invoked:

1. **MANDATORY EXECUTION** - Gates must be executed at specified points
2. **EVIDENCE COLLECTION** - All gate results must be documented
3. **VIOLATION BLOCKING** - Skipping gates triggers VIOLATION INDICATOR
4. **PATTERN LEARNING** - Success/failure patterns must be recorded

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** Attempting to proceed without gate execution is a critical violation.

## Purpose

Execute TAD's 4-gate quality system with BMAD-style enforcement to ensure consistent quality and evidence-based improvement.

## Gate Execution Protocol

## Evidence Collection Requirements

### For Each Gate Execution:
1. **Record Results**
```yaml
gate: [1|2|3|4]
date: [timestamp]
executor: [agent-a|agent-b]
result: [pass|fail]
issues_found: []
actions_taken: []
evidence_collected: []
patterns_identified: []
```

2. **Save to Evidence System**
- Location: `.tad/evidence/gates/[project]/gate[N]_[timestamp].yaml`
- Update patterns if new success/failure mode found
- Link to project log

3. **Pattern Recognition**
- If gate passes easily ‚Üí Record success pattern
- If gate fails ‚Üí Record failure pattern and root cause
- If pattern repeats ‚Üí Update framework configuration

## Violation Handling Protocol

### Level 1: Warning
```
‚ö†Ô∏è GATE WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
You are about to skip Gate [N]: [Name]
This may result in quality issues.

Continue anyway? (Not recommended)
Type 'OVERRIDE' to skip (will be logged):
```

### Level 2: Blocking
```
‚ö†Ô∏è GATE VIOLATION DETECTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
Type: Skipped Mandatory Gate
Gate: [N] - [Name]
Required Evidence: [List]
Action: BLOCKED - Cannot proceed

To continue, you must:
1. Execute the gate properly
2. Collect required evidence
3. Get pass result or handle failures
```

### Level 3: Critical
```
üö® CRITICAL VIOLATION üö®
Multiple gates skipped or failed
Pattern indicates systemic quality issues

Escalation Required:
1. Review all gate failures
2. Identify root causes
3. Update process or training
4. Get human approval to proceed
```

## Success Patterns Integration

When gates pass smoothly, record patterns:
- Which sub-agents were used effectively
- What preparation made gate passage easy
- Which documents were most helpful
- What parallel execution patterns worked

## Continuous Improvement

After each gate execution:
1. Update `.tad/evidence/metrics/gate-effectiveness.md`
2. Review patterns in `.tad/evidence/patterns/`
3. Consider framework configuration updates
4. Share learnings with team

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**‚ùå NEVER:**
- Skip gates to save time
- Pass gates with known issues
- Ignore evidence collection
- Override without documenting reason

**‚úÖ ALWAYS:**
- Execute gates at specified points
- Collect complete evidence
- Record patterns for learning
- Use violations as learning opportunities
- Treat gates as quality investment, not overhead
