# TAD Quality Gates - Manual Verification Checklists

## 🎯 Purpose
These manual checklists provide quality control when automated testing isn't available. Each gate requires explicit verification before proceeding to the next phase.

---

## 🚪 Gate 1: Requirements Clarity Gate

**Trigger:** After human provides requirements, before Agent A starts design

### ✅ Requirements Verification Checklist
**Agent A must verify:**
- [ ] **Business Value Clear**: Can explain WHY this is needed in one sentence
- [ ] **Success Criteria Defined**: Know exactly what "done" looks like
- [ ] **User Story Complete**: Has Who/What/Why structure
- [ ] **Scope Boundaries**: Clear about what's IN and what's OUT
- [ ] **Historical Code Searched**: Checked for existing similar implementations
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable and measurable criteria defined

### ⚠️ Gate Failure Conditions
- Business value unclear → Ask human for clarification
- Success criteria vague → Request specific metrics
- Missing user context → Gather user persona information
- No historical code search → Search before designing

### 📝 Gate Completion Template
```

```

## 🚪 Gate 2: Design Completeness Gate

**Trigger:** After Agent A completes design, before handoff to Agent B

### ✅ Design Verification Checklist
**Agent A must verify:**
- [ ] **Technical Specification Complete**: All components defined
- [ ] **Function Existence Verified**: All referenced functions actually exist
- [ ] **Data Flow Mapped**: Backend → Frontend path documented
- [ ] **API Design Detailed**: Endpoints, parameters, responses specified
- [ ] **User Safety Addressed**: Allergy warnings, health risks identified
- [ ] **Sub-Agent Plan Created**: Which sub-agents will be used when
- [ ] **Error Handling Designed**: Happy path + edge cases covered

### ✅ Handoff Package Verification
**Required in handoff to Agent B:**
- [ ] **File Paths Specified**: Exact files to modify/create
- [ ] **Function Names Listed**: Actual existing functions to use
- [ ] **UI Specification**: Layout, components, user interactions
- [ ] **Test Requirements**: What needs to be tested
- [ ] **Performance Targets**: Response time, load requirements

### ⚠️ Gate Failure Conditions
- Function names not verified → Search codebase to confirm existence
- Data flow incomplete → Map every step from API to UI
- Safety requirements missing → Add allergy/warning specifications
- Handoff package incomplete → Use standardized template

### 📝 Gate Completion Template
```
✅ DESIGN COMPLETENESS GATE PASSED
Date: [timestamp]
Verified by: Agent A (Alex)

Technical Specification: [✅ Complete / Details]
Function Verification: [List verified existing functions]
Data Flow: [Backend] → [Processing] → [Frontend display]
API Design: [Endpoint list with parameters]
Safety Features: [Allergy warnings, health alerts]
Sub-Agent Plan: [Which agents for which tasks]
Handoff Quality: [✅ Complete package using template]

Approved for implementation ✅
```

## 🚪 Gate 3: Implementation Quality Gate

**Trigger:** After Agent B writes code, before claiming completion

### ✅ Code Quality Verification Checklist
**Agent B must verify:**
- [ ] **Code Compiles**: No syntax errors, builds successfully
- [ ] **Function Calls Valid**: All called functions actually exist
- [ ] **Data Flow Working**: Backend calculations reach frontend display
- [ ] **User Interface Complete**: All computed fields visible to user
- [ ] **Safety Information Prominent**: Allergies/warnings clearly displayed
- [ ] **Error Handling Present**: Graceful handling of edge cases
- [ ] **Test Coverage Adequate**: Key functionality tested

### ✅ End-to-End Verification
**Agent B must test:**
- [ ] **API Response Valid**: Endpoints return expected data structure
- [ ] **Frontend Renders**: UI displays all backend-calculated fields
- [ ] **User Safety Visible**: Critical warnings are prominent
- [ ] **Performance Acceptable**: Response times meet requirements
- [ ] **Integration Working**: New code doesn't break existing features

### ⚠️ Gate Failure Conditions
- Code doesn't compile → Fix syntax/import errors
- Function not found → Use existing functions or implement missing ones
- Data not displayed → Complete data flow implementation
- Safety info hidden → Make warnings prominent and visible
- Tests failing → Fix code until tests pass

### 📝 Gate Completion Template
```
✅ IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY GATE PASSED
Date: [timestamp]
Verified by: Agent B (Blake)

Code Quality: [✅ Compiles / ✅ No errors]
Function Calls: [List verified function calls]
Data Flow: [✅ Backend → Frontend working]
UI Completeness: [✅ All fields displayed]
Safety Display: [✅ Warnings prominent]
Performance: [Response time: X ms]
Test Results: [X/Y tests passing]

Ready for review ✅
```

## 🚪 Gate 4: Integration Verification Gate

**Trigger:** After implementation, before delivery to human

### ✅ System Integration Checklist
**Both agents must verify:**
- [ ] **Feature Works End-to-End**: Complete user journey functional
- [ ] **Existing Features Intact**: Regression testing passed
- [ ] **Performance Maintained**: No significant degradation
- [ ] **Security Standards Met**: No new vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] **User Experience Smooth**: Intuitive and error-free interactions
- [ ] **Documentation Updated**: Changes reflected in docs

### ✅ Delivery Package Verification
**Required for human handoff:**
- [ ] **Working Software**: Demonstrable functionality
- [ ] **Test Evidence**: Screenshots or test results
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Response times, load handling
- [ ] **Known Issues**: Any limitations or future work needed
- [ ] **User Guide**: How to use the new feature

### ⚠️ Gate Failure Conditions
- Feature incomplete → Continue implementation
- Existing features broken → Fix regressions
- Performance degraded → Optimize bottlenecks
- Security concerns → Address vulnerabilities
- UX problems → Improve user interactions

### 📝 Gate Completion Template
```
✅ INTEGRATION VERIFICATION GATE PASSED
Date: [timestamp]
Verified by: Agent A & Agent B

Feature Status: [✅ Working end-to-end]
Regression Tests: [✅ No existing features broken]
Performance: [✅ Maintained / Improved]
Security: [✅ No new vulnerabilities]
User Experience: [✅ Smooth and intuitive]

## 🎛️ Gate Management Guidelines

### Manual Gate Execution
1. **Copy checklist** for each gate execution
2. **Fill out each checkbox** explicitly
3. **Document evidence** for each verification
4. **Get explicit approval** before proceeding
5. **Archive completed checklists** in `.tad/working/gates/`

### Emergency Gate Override
If critical business need requires bypassing a gate:
1. **Document the business reason** for override
2. **List the risks** being accepted
3. **Create follow-up tasks** to address skipped checks
4. **Get explicit human approval** for override

### Gate Quality Metrics
Track gate effectiveness:
- **Gate pass rate**: % of first-time gate passes
- **Issue prevention**: Bugs caught at gates vs. in production
- **Cycle time**: Time between gates
- **Rework frequency**: How often gates fail

### Continuous Improvement
After each project:
- **Review gate effectiveness**: Which gates caught real issues?
- **Identify missed issues**: What got through that shouldn't have?
- **Update checklists**: Add new verification points
- **Train agents**: Share learnings from gate experiences
