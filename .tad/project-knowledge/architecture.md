Project-specific architecture learnings accumulated through TAD workflow.

## Foundational: TAD Framework Architecture

> Established at project inception.

### Two-Agent System
- **Alex (Solution Lead)**: Design, planning, requirements, business acceptance
- **Blake (Execution Master)**: Implementation, testing, technical quality

### Four-Gate Quality System
- Gate 1: Requirements Clarity
- Gate 2: Design Completeness
- Gate 3: Implementation Quality (v2.0: expanded)
- Gate 4: Integration/Acceptance (v2.0: simplified)

## Accumulated Learnings

<!-- Entries from development experience below -->

### Ralph Loop Two-Layer Architecture - 2026-01-26
- **Context**: Implementing TAD v2.0 Blake + Ralph Loop Fusion
- **Discovery**: The two-layer quality architecture (Layer 1: fast self-check, Layer 2: expert review) is a reusable pattern for iterative quality assurance. Key principles:
  1. **Separation of Concerns**: Cheap/fast checks (build, lint) separate from expensive/slow checks (expert review)
  2. **Expert Exit Conditions**: Quality is judged by specialized agents, not self-assessment
  3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Detect stuck states (3 same errors) and escalate automatically
  4. **State Persistence**: Enable crash recovery without losing progress
  5. **Priority Groups**: Sequential blocking gate (code-reviewer) before parallel verification
- **Action**: This pattern can be applied to other iterative workflows where quality needs external validation

### Gate Responsibility Matrix - 2026-01-26
- **Context**: Restructuring Gate 3 and Gate 4 for v2.0
- **Discovery**: Clear separation of technical vs business responsibilities improves gate efficiency:
  - Technical experts (code-reviewer, test-runner, security, performance) → Blake's Gate 3 v2
  - Business acceptance (requirement verification, user approval) → Alex's Gate 4 v2
- **Action**: When designing quality gates, separate technical automation from business judgment

### Cognitive Firewall: Embed Into Existing Flows, Don't Create New Ones - 2026-02-06
- **Context**: Designing a 3-pillar human empowerment system (decision transparency, research-first, fatal operation protection)
- **Discovery**: Cross-cutting concerns (like "human must approve tech decisions") are most effective when embedded into existing mandatory flows (Gates, Alex design phase, Blake execution) rather than creating standalone commands or modules. Key pattern:
  1. **Insert, don't create**: New protocol inserted between Socratic Inquiry and Design — guaranteed to run
  2. **Gate enforcement**: Risk Translation in Gate 3 makes protection mandatory, not optional
  3. **Escalation over automation**: Blake PAUSE (not auto-proceed) respects terminal isolation principle
  4. **Handoff-awareness**: Risk checks must understand intent to avoid blocking legitimate operations
- **Action**: When adding cross-cutting quality/safety concerns, embed them as mandatory steps in existing flows rather than creating separate commands that can be forgotten
