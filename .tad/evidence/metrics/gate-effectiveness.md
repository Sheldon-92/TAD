- Runtime error prevention: [Track prevented errors]

**Success Indicators:**
- âœ… Gate pass rate > 95%
- âœ… Compilation success > 90%
- âœ… Runtime errors < 5%

### Gate 4: Integration Verification Gate
**Purpose:** Ensure complete system functionality

**Baseline Metrics (Pre-TAD):**
- Integration issues: 50% of deliveries
- Regression bugs: 30% of releases
- User experience problems: 40% of features

**Current Performance:**
- Gate pass rate: [Track per project]
- Integration success: [Track smooth integrations]
- Regression prevention: [Track prevented regressions]

**Success Indicators:**
- âœ… Gate pass rate > 85%
- âœ… Integration issues < 15%
- âœ… Regression bugs < 10%

- Strengthen business value training

**Gate 2 (Design) < 90% pass rate:**
- Improve function verification process
- Enhance data flow mapping tools
- Strengthen handoff template usage

**Gate 3 (Implementation) < 95% pass rate:**
- Improve pre-implementation verification
- Enhance bug-hunter utilization
- Strengthen test-first development

**Gate 4 (Integration) < 85% pass rate:**
- Improve integration testing process
- Enhance regression test coverage
- Strengthen user experience validation

### When Gates Are Too Easy (High Pass Rates but Issues Still Escape)
- Strengthen gate criteria
- Add additional verification points
- Improve issue detection methods
- Enhance checklist comprehensiveness

## ðŸ“Š ROI Analysis

### Time Investment in Gates
**Estimated Time per Gate:**
- Gate 1: 10-15 minutes
- Gate 2: 15-20 minutes
- Gate 3: 10-15 minutes
- Gate 4: 20-25 minutes
- **Total: 55-75 minutes per project**

### Time Saved by Issue Prevention
**Estimated Rework Time Prevented:**
- Requirements issues: 2-4 hours per issue
- Function errors: 1-2 hours per error
- Data flow issues: 1-3 hours per issue
