## 📊 Evidence Categories

### 1. Project Evidence
**Collected per project execution:**
- Original human requirements
- Agent A design decisions and reasoning
- Agent B implementation approach and results
- Quality gate execution results
- Issues encountered and resolutions
- Final delivery assessment

### 2. Pattern Evidence
**Accumulated across projects:**
- Successful collaboration patterns
- Common failure modes and causes
- Effective sub-agent utilization
- Quality gate effectiveness
- Framework improvement opportunities

### 3. Metric Evidence
**Quantitative measurements:**
- Gate pass/fail rates by type
- Time to resolution for different issue types
- Sub-agent utilization frequency
- Quality trend analysis
- Framework adoption effectiveness

## 🔄 Evidence Collection Protocol

### During Project Execution
1. **Requirements Phase**: Copy original requirements to project evidence folder
2. **Design Phase**: Record Agent A's design decisions and sub-agent usage
3. **Implementation Phase**: Track Agent B's approach and problem-solving
4. **Quality Gates**: Archive all gate execution checklists
5. **Delivery**: Document final results and lessons learned

### After Project Completion
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Identify new success/failure patterns
2. **Metric Update**: Update quantitative measurements
3. **Improvement Identification**: Note framework enhancement opportunities
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Update pattern documentation

## 🎓 Learning from Evidence

### Success Pattern Examples
- "When Agent A uses product-expert for requirements analysis, projects have 85% first-time gate pass rate"
- "Agent B using parallel-coordinator reduces implementation time by 40%"
- "Function existence verification prevents 95% of runtime errors"

### Failure Pattern Examples
- "Skipping historical code search leads to 60% rework rate"
- "Missing safety requirements causes 100% user experience issues"
- "Incomplete data flow mapping creates 80% frontend display problems"

### Improvement Opportunities
- Framework configuration updates based on patterns
- Agent training enhancement based on common mistakes
- Quality gate refinement based on effectiveness data
- Sub-agent guidance improvement based on usage patterns
