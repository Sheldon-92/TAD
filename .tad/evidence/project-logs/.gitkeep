# Project Evidence Logs

This directory contains evidence from individual TAD project executions.

Each project should have its own subdirectory with:
- requirements.md: Original human requirements
- agent-interactions/: Conversation logs between agents
- code-changes/: Before/after code comparisons
- quality-gates/: Gate execution results
- delivery-report.md: Final delivery evidence

Example structure:
```
