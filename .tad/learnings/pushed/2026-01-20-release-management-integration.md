## Learning Entry

- **Date**: 2026-01-20 00:00
- **Agent**: Alex
- **Category**: workflow
- **Status**: pushed

### Discovery

TAD framework lacked guidance for version release management in multi-platform projects (Web + iOS + future mini-programs). Key gaps identified:

1. **No release responsibility assignment** - Unclear whether Alex or Blake should handle releases
2. **No release-specific gates** - Standard Gate 3/4 don't cover pre-release and post-release verification
3. **No cross-platform coordination** - Web (auto-deploy) vs iOS (manual build) need different workflows
4. **No SemVer integration** - No guidance on version bump decisions

### Suggestion

**1. Add Release Management section to TAD config:**
```yaml
release_management:
  versioning:
    strategy: semver
    source_of_truth: package.json

  release_types:
    routine_release:
      authority: Blake
      gates: [Gate 3R]
    major_release:
      authority: Alex (planning) + Blake (execution)
      gates: [Gate 2, Gate 3R, Gate 4R]
      template: release-handoff.md
```

**2. Define Agent responsibilities:**
- **Alex**: Version strategy, major release planning, breaking change analysis
- **Blake**: Routine release execution, iOS builds, release gates

**3. Add release-specific gates:**
- **Gate 3R (Release Quality)**: Pre-release checklist (tests, build, CHANGELOG, version bump)
- **Gate 4R (Release Verification)**: Post-release verification (deployment, health check)

**4. Create release task and template:**
- `.tad/tasks/release-execution.md` - Executable release workflow
- `.tad/templates/release-handoff.md` - Major release handoff template

**5. Add release commands to agents:**
- Alex: `*release plan` - Plan major release
- Blake: `*release patch`, `*release minor`, `*release ios`

### Implementation Reference

Files created/updated in Menu Snap project:
- `.tad/config.yaml` - Added `release_management` section (~160 lines)
- `.tad/tasks/release-execution.md` - New release task
- `.tad/templates/release-handoff.md` - Release handoff template
- `.tad/gates/quality-gate-checklist.md` - Added Gate 3R & 4R
- `.claude/commands/tad-alex.md` - Added release_duties
- `.claude/commands/tad-blake.md` - Added release_duties
- `.claude/commands/tad-help.md` - Added release commands
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added version release rules

### Source

Menu Snap project required multi-platform release coordination (Web on Vercel, iOS on App Store). User asked about industry standard version management practices (SemVer, CHANGELOG, deployment SOPs) and how to integrate with TAD methodology.

### Impact Assessment

- **Clarity**: Clear division of release responsibilities between Alex and Blake
- **Quality**: Release-specific gates ensure proper verification
- **Scalability**: Framework ready for multi-platform projects
- **Consistency**: Standardized release workflow across projects
